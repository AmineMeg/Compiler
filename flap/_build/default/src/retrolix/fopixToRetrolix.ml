(** This module implements a compiler from Fopix to Retrolix. *)

(**

    Here are the two main problems to be solved.

    1. Fopix has complex expressions while Retrolix has only atomic
   instructions. In addition, in Fopix, scopes can arbitrarily nested
   while Retrolix has only one scope per function.

    2. Fopix is independent from the calling conventions of the target
   architecture while Retrolix is not. In particular, hardware registers
   are used in Retrolix to pass the first arguments to a function while
   in Fopix there is no such mechanism.
