   To construct the interference graph:

   1. At any non-move instruction that defines variable a (where
   live-out variables are b1, ..., bj) add interference edges (a, b1),
   ..., (a, bj).

   2. At a move instruction a ‚Üê c (where variables b1, ..., bj are
   live-out) add interference edges (a, b1), ..., (a, bj) for any bi
   that is not the same as c. Besides, add an preference edge (a, c)
   if a and c are not in interference. Notice that interference
   overrides preference: if a subsequel instruction implies an
   interference between a and c, the preference relation is removed.

   [forbidden] represents the list of global variables: they must not be
   colorized. Hence, they more or less behave as the hardware registers.
