   The translation from Hobix to Fopix turns anonymous
   lambda-abstractions into toplevel functions and applications into
   function calls. In other words, it translates a high-level language
   (like OCaml) into a first order language (like C).

   To do so, we follow the closure conversion technique.

   The idea is to make explicit the construction of closures, which
   represent functions as first-class objects. A closure is a block
   that contains a code pointer to a toplevel function [f] followed by all
   the values needed to execute the body of [f]. For instance, consider
   the following OCaml code:

   let f =
     let x = 6 * 7 in
     let z = x + 1 in
     fun y -> x + y * z

   The values needed to execute the function "fun y -> x + y * z" are
   its free variables "x" and "z". The same program with explicit usage
   of closure can be written like this:

   let g y env = env[1] + y * env[2]
   let f =
      let x = 6 * 7 in
      let z = x + 1 in
      [| g; x; z |]

   (in an imaginary OCaml in which arrays are untyped.)

   Once closures are explicited, there are no more anonymous functions!

   But, wait, how to we call such a function? Let us see that on an
   example:

   let f = ... (* As in the previous example *)
   let u = f 0

   The application "f 0" must be turned into an expression in which
   "f" is a closure and the call to "f" is replaced to a call to "g"
   with the proper arguments. The argument "y" of "g" is known from
   the application: it is "0". Now, where is "env"? Easy! It is the
   closure itself! We get:

   let g y env = env[1] + y * env[2]
   let f =
      let x = 6 * 7 in
      let z = x + 1 in
      [| g; x; z |]
   let u = f[0] 0 f

   (Remark: Did you notice that this form of "auto-application" is
   very similar to the way "this" is defined in object-oriented
   programming languages?)

    A closure compilation environment relates an identifier to the way
    it is accessed in the compiled version of the function's
    body.

    Indeed, consider the following example. Imagine that the following
    function is to be compiled:

    fun x -> x + y

    In that case, the closure compilation environment will contain:

    x -> x
    y -> "the code that extract the value of y from the closure environment"

    Indeed, "x" is a local variable that can be accessed directly in
    the compiled version of this function's body whereas "y" is a free
    variable whose value must be retrieved from the closure's
    environment.
