(** The compilation environment.
    ———————————————————————————–

    To translate a program written in a source language into another
    semantically equivalent program written in a target language, it
    is convenient to carry some information about the correspondence
    between the two programs along the process. The compilation
    environment is meant to that.

    In this particular pass, we want to remember an assignment of
    integers to constructor and label identifiers. Therefore, the
    compilation environment is composed of two maps representing these
    assignments. The environment is populated each time we cross a
    type definitions while it is read each time we translate language
    constructions related to record and tagged values.

module ConstructorMap = Map.Make (struct
  type t = HopixAST.constructor
  let compare = compare
end)

module LabelMap = Map.Make (struct
  type t = HopixAST.label
  let compare = compare
end)

type environment = {
  constructor_tags : Int64.t ConstructorMap.t;
  label_positions  : Int64.t LabelMap.t;
}

let initial_environment () = {
  constructor_tags = ConstructorMap.empty;
  label_positions  = LabelMap.empty;
}

let index_of_constructor env k =
  ConstructorMap.find k env.constructor_tags

let position_of_label env l =
  LabelMap.find l env.label_positions

(** Code generation
    ———————————————

    A compilation pass produces code. We could directly
    write down caml expressions made of applications of
    HobixAST constructors. Yet, the resulting code would
    be ugly...

    A better way consists in defining functions that build
    Hobix AST terms and are convenient to use. Here are a
    list of functions that may be convenient to you when
    you will implement this pass.
